# Card_Project
This card project showcases two stylish cards, each presenting different content using HTML and CSS.
Each card represents different content and styling.
The first card showcasing an QR code image, a title, and a description. 
The second card is an order summary with an image, text, pricing details, and buttons for further actions. 

The project demonstrates the use of flexbox, positioning, gradients, borders, and box-shadows to create engaging card layouts.
